I was thinking about using a counter and checking each doc in a brute force, worst case kind of scenario, but I'm still thinking about  the like recursive approach/base case/optimal substructure for this problem. |

| Feb 8  | 315pm-345pm | I realized that I was doing doc1.charAt(i) where i was going from 1 all the way to doc1.length() which was causing the index ouf of bounds. After I changed str.charAt(i) to i-1, I passed the edge case only. I also realize that this algorithm works for when the subsequence is in a row not when the characters are not all adjacent to each other. I changed it so that when the characters at i and j don't match, the dp[i][j] is not just 0 and it continuously tracks the matching. Yay it works now. After solving it I lowkey realize that I also did this problem like last year too. |
