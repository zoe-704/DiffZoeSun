| Feb 6 | 1130-12pm | Lily and I were discussing our ideas for this problem set together during class. I was thinking about using a counter and checking each doc in a brute force, worst case kind of scenario, but I'm still thinking about  the like recursive approach/base case/optimal substructure for this problem. |
